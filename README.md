  This cipher is the most well-known polyalphabetic cipher, which is invented to make difficult the frequency analysis and the brute force attack.
	This method of encryption has remained an unbreakable cipher for many years after it was invented. It was broken by British cryptograph Charles Babbage 200 years later after the invention.
